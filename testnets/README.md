## Testnets

Testnets are a type of blockchain used exclusively for testing purposes. They function as a sandbox environment, allowing developers to test new code and functionalities without worrying about affecting the live blockchain (mainnet). They are persistent environments, meaning that they remain active for extended periods of time.

Testnets come with a range of integrated services, including relayers to other testnets, frontends, explorers, and snapshot services.

#### Join the testnet

Join the testnet following the instructions on the [nillion-testnet-1 page](./testnets/nillion-testnet-1/README.md).

## Devnets

Devnets, short for development networks, are also used for testing new functionalities and code. However, unlike testnets, devnets are temporary environments.

Devnets are ephemeral, which means they do not persist state long term and are recreated on an ongoing basis. This ensures that the testing environment closely mirrors the current state of the latest nillion codebase. Devnets are minimal environments, consisting only of a validator. Unlike testnets, devnets do not feature frontends or relayers to other testnets.
